name: Region capture
description: |
  Region Capture is an API for cropping video tracks derived from screen-capturing a tab.

  The API consists of two parts.

  First, a `CropTarget` object is minted from an HTMLElement `e`, representing an element within the captured tab.

  Second, `cropTo()` is invoked on the video track, with the aforementioned `CropTarget` as input, after which frames deliver on that track will be cropped to `e`'s bounding box.

  Calling `cropTo(null)` restores the track to its original, uncropped form.
